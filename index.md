I'm a Ph.D. candidate in Public Administration and Government at the São Paulo Fundação Getulio Vargas’s Sao Paulo School of Business Administration (FGV-EAESP), in Brazil. I also hold a Master's degree in Public Management and International Cooperation from the Federal University of Paraíba (UFPB) and a Bachelor's degree in Public Policies from the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte (UFRN), both in Brazil.

My research interests focus on the dynamics of federalism and the relationship between local governments, political institutions, and public policies. More specifically, my research interests include:

- Intergovernmental cooperation
- Political economy of local governments collective action
- Diffusion of public policies at the subnational level
- Local state capacities
- Causal inference
